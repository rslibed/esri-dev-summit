Where: Catalina | Renaissance Hotel

Speakers: Kelly Hutchins & Ryan Libed

Join Esriâ€™s dev team to learn how we built ArcGIS Instant Apps with modern frameworks and tools so that you can create your own focused and consistent web applications to interact with maps, layers and apps in your organization. In this session, you will learn how to use Typescript and how to leverage Calcite Components and instant app components (such as interactive legends filter, share and more) with the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript to build and customize your web apps.
